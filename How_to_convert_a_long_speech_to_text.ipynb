              "\"Chapter 9. Into the unknown. Scientific questions. We live in an age of instant answers. I googled this question. How do we know the earth is round. In less than one second i had 168 million results at my fingertips. If i spend one minutes on each it would take me 320 years to get through the mall. We live in an age of assertion. I can fire up a tweet or post an opinion no matter how accurate for incendiary. And get the attention of the crowd. Maybe even go viral. Politician throw out untruths or half-truths. And even when proven wrong they will double down and start again. In 2015 representative lamar smith. Chairman of the house committee on science space and technology declared authoritatively that climate data clearly showed no warming for the past two decades. You didn't back down even though 14 of the 15 years from 2000 to 2015. Login is the hottest on record according to data from nasa. Truth is often eclipse by attitude. Instant answers and easy assertion populate our digital information age. I can surround myself with friends and associates virtual or real. Who will be my echo chamber. Ratifying my ideas and validating my logic. I can leave in a media universe where everyone will agree with me. And my social media tribe will submit my certainty. How do we slow it down. Can we allow ourselves to be wrong. Can we ask in a different way. Up to now my quest to understand how we ask more of ourselves and one another at taking me through several lines of inquiry each connected to its own distinct outcome he's calling for its own unique approach. In all of them the artful question leads to information and awareness understanding and answers. But there's a line of inquiry characterized by the slow question. The one that doesn't yield an immediate answer. And dares you to embrace uncertainty. I wondered. Can a slow question the kind that requires painstaking work and enduring patience. Will you try to prove yourself wrong in order to see if you might be right. Be a viable alternative in our world of instant answers. Can i prove to be a reliable path to truth. The answer of course is yes. The slow question exists with a distinctly different approach. It is expressed for the inquisitive lens of science. Which ventures into the unknown thinking to explain the mysteries of the physical world. This questioning method represents a way of asking that recognizes the vastness and uncertainties of the unexplored. The method build logically from the ground up. Observe a problem prima question. Take what you see or know to be objectively and measurably true from the real world and ask a question. What's going on here what's causing this. Offer an explanation. Based on your observations your experiences and the facts and data that exist. Put together a clear hypothesis that could explain the situation. Put your hypothesis to the test. Experiment and measure overtime. Try to prove yourself wrong. What else could explain the situation. Did you miss. What could be wrong with your approaching your data. If your hypothesis holds up your making progress. Cher. If you think you're onto something shop it around and show it to other knowledgeable people let them review it. They see something that you didn't do they have any problem with your data or your methods. If not. You might just have a theory you can act on. Scientific questioning drives a process that revolves around data experimentation an observable fact. It is a method of tackles a daunting quest and challenges attention span. Answer world. The discipline this line of questioning and poses makes for a better inquiry and better decisions across-the-board. Think back to a choice you made or an action you took but didn't turn out the way you hoped. Ever wonder how different things would have been if you'd had more information or. Look at what you did have a bit more skeptically. Have you ever worked off an untested instinct or an unchallenged belief and then wished. Knowing what you know now. You could do it all over again. Would that you could have road-tested your hunch before you acted on them. I would things have been different if you could have been more scientific and selecting the car you bought. Or the business you invested in. What if you could turn your search for answers into a science. The doctors quest. I wondered. Can we inject a little scientific method. Either the questions we confront everyday. How can scientific questioning be useful to the rest of us. First i had to see how it works. I went to the sprawling campus of the national institutes of health. The nih just outside washington dc. Speak with one of the country's leading scientist. He's worked all his life trying to figure out the unknown in a world where research is subject to criticism hypotheses exist to be disproved. And answers lead to more questions. The world of science in bethesda maryland stands in joelton contrast to the political world of washington just down the road. What people expect questions to be answered quickly and decisively. But unlike the political world science celebrates discovery and the unknown represents a challenge not a weakness. In science facts are things to be learned not exploited. Data not opinion holds sway. Dr. anthony fauci has led the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases for more than three decades. In a town where everyone picks side fauci has mostly stayed out of politics. He sees himself as an honest broker of science. It gives little cretins to political labels and has no patience for ideology that obscures discovery or stands in the way of cures. Fauci deals with medical fact. And the painstaking meticulous research of biological science is questions grow out of his observations and insatiable thirst for research and for cures to disease. Fauci greeted me outside his spacious office a few minutes after 7 a.m.. This was not his first piece of business for the day. Get his desk and sex. He had a reputation as a workaholic a non-stop guy a small super-fit man in his 70s who never lost his brooklyn accent. Fauci still ran and worked marathon days. It's suite of offices was crammed with books and journals and offered a gallery of his life. Pictures with patients presidents doctors and researchers from around the world hung from the walls. They highlights ouchies work against the killer diseases. Hiv-aids stars. Malaria. Ebola. And the zika virus. Country with especially proud of one picture. Taken around 1989 it shows him with president george hw bush and his wife barbara. Sitting in a crowded semicircle with researchers and aids patients. President bush had just approved a large increase in its funding hitachi and saud. It was a sharp turn from bushes predecessor ronald reagan. The funding open to research pipeline that led to effective treatments for hiv aids and brought dramatic and desperately needed breakthroughs. They came however only after years of suffering controversy. And research. A mystery killer. I first encountered fauci in the early 1980s when he briefed on a mysterious ailment that seem to be targeting gay men. The disease didn't even have a name yet. I was covering the white house where president reagan was reluctant even to talk about it. He and his wife nancy had plenty of gay friends from the days in california. The actor rock hudson the first major celebrity to die of the disease had attended the state dinner hosted by the reagan's just three weeks before he was diagnosed. But the element with its implications of homosexuality was a taboo subject in politics at the time. Found she had always been a question. Explorer. Like other scientists and researchers he would see a problem a disease or an illness become fascinated by it. And turn it into a research question. Arrived in some fashion from the most fundamental question in the universe. What's going on here. The autoimmune system admin fauci specialty in medical school. Trained in immunology and infectious disease he was absorbed by the question of why the human immune system sometimes turned on itself. Robbing the body of its ability to fight off illness and infection. In his early work as a young researcher at nih. Thought you had been researching an autoimmune disorder known as the gunners granulomatosis. Disease inflames the blood vessels in the lungs kidneys and upper airway symptoms include nosebleeds sinus pain coughing up blood skin sores and fever. In a laboratory two floors above him cancer researchers were conducting groundbreaking research into hodgkin's disease. Fauci regularly ran into his colleagues in the hallways or over a meal. They compared notes shared observations and told stories as doctors do. One thing his colleagues told him in particular caught his attention. It seems cancer patients were prone to infectious diseases. As a result of their chemotherapy. The chemo not only suppress the cancerous tumors. But also the patient's own immune systems. Fauci wondered. Could you turn off the immune system without killing the patient in order to cure a disease. Fauci hypothesized that a delicate balance of low-dose anti-cancer drugs could suppress the immune system invega nurse patients. Megan has had no cure treatments had so far been ineffective. Dr. tried corticoid steroids in prednisone but patients remained dangerously prone to bacterial infection or the flu. The testis hypothesis fauci research team began experimenting with low levels of chemo drugs and control groups. They conducted clinical trials and pitted the new drugs against placebos. They tracked their patients over months and kept meticulous records about their health age condition and progress. To my incredible gratification and i think a little luck. you told me. It turned out that the drugs that we picked we're just right. The drugs also proved effective for other autoimmune diseases and fauci quickly made a name for himself. He appeared to be on track for an extraordinary career in the field of immunology. Then something unforeseen happened to change pouches life. It began in his office on a saturday morning early in june 1981. Fauci was scanning the morbidity and mortality weekly report. Put out by the centers for disease control. He ran an item about five gay men in los angeles who had died as a result of a pneumocystis pneumonia. Caused by a fungus commonly found in the lungs of healthy people this form of pneumonia can become deadly in those with weakened immune systems. Fauci did a double-take. And have them self. What's going on. Why are gay men. White pneumocystis pneumonia in otherwise healthy gay men. At first fauci thought recreational drugs might be the problem. That wasn't his field of expertise however and he was busy with wagner's research. What the hell he figured forget it. A month later another cdc morbidity report if how she's deaf. It featured another alert about the same mysterious illness. Now it reported the 26 men had died. And not just in los angeles. Victims were in new york city and san francisco is well. All were gay all seemed in perfect health before coming down with deadly pneumonia. Fauci was alarmed. This is going to be huge he said to himself. Cultures clash. Science medicine and experience drove fauci to conclude that we were on the verge of a full-blown health crisis. A new and frightening lee unpredictable illness was dimensions were completely unknown. He responded as a scientist and is a doctor. Thinking in terms of public health. He has been trained to observe a problem and asked about it in a methodical way putting impulse in judgment to the side. Outside the gates of science and the nih however there was an altogether different response. I was the white house correspondent for associated press radio. I had recently returned from london where i've been based is a foreign correspondent. Now i was assigned to a noisy cramped show-off you place where reporters strutted their stuff to show how tough or influential they were. And the press secretary played power politics leaking stories to those yeelight and freezing out those he thought were unfair unfriendly or overly hostile. Welcome to the white house briefing room. We were just a few miles from nih but we were in another universe. On this day in october 1980 to someone in the press corps asked about this new and deadly illness but few others wanted to talk about. The reporter lester consulting was with worldnetdaily a conservative news organization committed to exposing wrongdoing corruption and abuse of power. Is questions to reagan's press secretary larry speaks produced. A surreal moment. Kinsolving. Larry does the president have any reaction to the announcement by the centers for disease control in atlanta that aids is now an epidemic in over 600 cases. Speaks. What's aids. Consolidating. Over a third of them have died if known as gay plague. Laughter. No it is i mean it's a pretty serious thing that one in every three people that get this has died. I wondered if the president is aware of it. Speaks. I don't have it to you. Laughter. Consulting. No i don't. Speaks. You didn't answer my question. Involving well i just wondered is the president. Speaks how do you know. Laughter. Consulting. In other words the white house looks on this is a great joke. Speaks. No i don't know anything about it lester. Involving. Does the president does anybody in the white house know about this epidemic larry. Speaks. I don't think so i don't think there's been any insolvent. Nobody knows. Thanks. There's been no personal experience here. In retrospect and with full knowledge about the suffering to come. The words and laughter from that white house briefing ring especially cruel. The exchange revealed ignorance fear and the disconnect between politics and science. A deadly disease appeared to be striking young gay men that the president have a reaction. No the press secretary replied implying. None of us around here are gay enough to have had that experience. Fix made no comment about the health dimension for the research that was needed to solve the crisis. He made no reference to public health or education. Address the questions through his peculiar political filter. It's impossible to look back on this exchange and not find it appalling. But a variation of it happens with alarming frequency. We often respond emotionally or dismissively the problems we don't understand. Science on the other hand teaches us to step back. Slow down. And ask simply and dispassionately. What's going on here. Why is it happening. What is causing or influencing. Test but verify. The methodical logical approach to scientific investigation provides a blueprint for inquiry that rewards reality not emotion one-step-at-a-time. Start with the fact. What have you observed or what do you know with a high degree of certainty. Thought you knew from the cdc reports that young gay men were dying of a form of pneumonia that only strikes people whose immune systems have been compromised. Formulate your question. What's going on and why. Why would these young men dying of a disease that wasn't supposed to attack healthy people. Couches team wanted to know. Develop a hypothesis your explanation for what you've observed. Contested. In many ways this hypothesis is the crux of scientific inquiry. The ancient greek origins of the word offer an explanation. Aibo means foundation. And thesis means placing. Many people confuse hypotheses with series thinking they're one in the same. But a hypothesis comes before a theory or explanation. It's the soil below the basement of scientific thought. Charles darwin had a hypothesis. That plant and animal species originated through competition and natural selection. Only half a century later after vast amounts of research an observation did scientists elevate that hypothesis into a theory. The foundation of an entire field of science. Country's hypothesis was that an autoimmune disease with killing these young men. And it was a new disease the world had not previously seen. Through experimentation testing measurement and documentation. Fauci work to see if his hypothesis held up. Only by submitting ideas to rigorous experimentation measurement and scrutiny if the hypothetical ground was stable enough to support the foundation of theory. This meant sharing findings with peers loontern set out to disprove the hypothesis. Think how different this line of inquiry is from politics or business. And so much else in life. So many questions tend to be rhetorical thinking answers that prove people right. Or at least on the right side. In science you're trying to prove yourself wrong. Triumph comes when you cannot. It means you have a reasonably stable hypothesis. If your hypothesis survive this scientific trial by fire you have an explanation. But even then you haven't achieved total certainty. In science no answer is ever complete because after your fly is answered it breathes an infinite number of wise. There is more research to be done new discoveries to make. These principles. Facts. Hypothesis test. And beat your guidepost to bring science. If you're questioning. They will apply in different ways as you connect your observations and facts for your experiments trying to determine whether your answers hold up to scrutiny. Be prepared to think differently. Because you have to go into the process embracing uncertainty reaching into the unknown knowing answers will take time. Stretch yourself. What's that you had a bad car accident. You came out of it with three broken ribs whiplash bad bruises and persistent pain. You know you're lucky to be alive and still able to move it all. But you hurt like hell. You go to physical therapy and that seems to help. Doesn't go away. Your doctor prescribed pain meds but you hate them they send you into orbit and i don't believe all the pain anyway. Some friends tell you to try yoga. You read up on it and decide to give it a go. You're desperate so it's worth the effort. It's not exactly fun and wipes you out. But after a couple of months you think you're feeling a little less pain. Is it the yoga that's making the difference. Or your body just healing over time. Yoga is working. Maybe yoga can move your body in joints and muscles. Minimize the pain from your injury. Central hypothesis. You decide to try a little experiment and see if your hypothesis hold up. You stopped the yoga. Within a few days you're pretty sure the pain is getting worse. Sometimes it's hard to tell because it's been such a constant part of your life since the accident. Everyday you chart your pain rating it on a scale of 1 to 10. When you wake up. At lunch time before dinner and when you go to bed. After a few weeks you see a trend. Your pain is worse in the morning after you get up. It goes down around lunch. Picks up again around dinner and takes up a little more before bedtime. It follows this pattern over several weeks. You wonder if the morning pain is due to stiffness from sleeping. Because you're going to bed with more pain and sleeping poorly. Wonder whether the increase in pain in the evening. Is because you're just tired and feeling it more. Or whether you're feeling the effects of a day's worth of activity. You decide to start the yoga again. This time doing it twice a day. In the morning when you wake up. And again just before bed. After another couple of weeks to see a change. Your pain still peaks in the morning but it's down from where it was when you weren't doing the yoga. It still takes up around dinner but now it goes back down before bedtime. You conclude yoga twice a day is helping. It can't be 100% sure that it's just the yoga. But your charting your experience indicator connection between more yoga and less pain. Congratulations. You did your own simple scientific experiment. You feel better. Nina federoff a plant biologist and former president of the american association for the advancement of science. Explain scientific inquiry to me by putting it in terms of mental constructs. The various ways to discipline have of interpreting reality. In literature imagination does the work of making sense of the world. In law judges use precedence to interpret the law. Science she says links ideas to repeated observation and repeatable results of experimentation. Scientist federoff explained. Okay i have this idea then apps. How do i test my idea. How can my idea be wrong. In the practical world there are few incentives to incorporate the mindset that accompanies this type of questioning. Into our lives and our work. It could be awkward to stand up in front of your boss and say okay i've got this idea for a new product but maybe i'm wrong. It would be odd to hear someone at the city council meeting to claire. I know how to make trash pickup more efficient but we need to test it because. I want to see if i'm wrong. Imagine hearing a political candidate say. I have a plan to raise taxes it will reduce the deficit and save social security but. There's some real uncertainty here. In most cases we are rewarded for decisiveness and quick answers. The person at the meeting who speaks up with authority and offers to fix the problem. Is often the one who's praised and promoted. When we proposed an idea we don't stay the boss or the shareholders. I think i'm onto something here but i'm doing my best to prove it wrong. We're expected to defend our point. Not openly invite others to attack it. The discipline of scientific question and however moved us toward a more methodical form of inquiry. Inviting more data and better measurement into the questions we ask. Any answers we get. In silicon valley where most everything is measured. One of the most important tools for improving online product. Is a simple form of experiment called a b testing. Tech companies try out new features by offering a small percentage of users an updated app while most others use the old one. If the new version performs better determined by metric such is how many clicks it gets or how many purchases are made. It's crowned the winner and becomes the version that everyone sees. If not the better-performing original stays in place. This data-driven approach favors empirical results to pick winning ideas. Instead of the slickest sales pitch for the most confident employee. As data becomes more accessible we can expect more science and more metric in the decision in questioning process. You have a new product you'd like to put into production. You think should expand your business over-seasoned take advantage of a rising global middle class. You're thinking of buying a salmon hatchery in alaska. Applying some scientific inquiry would force you to slow down in order to observe. Hypothesized experiment. And quantify before leaping to conclusions. Maybe that bed and breakfast in vermont. Is the better investment after all. All answers to slow questions. For tony fauci hiv aids research was heartbreakingly frustrating. Because time was on no one's side. People died while he and other scientists painstakingly went about their work. Conducting experiments and proving themselves wrong. While researchers were testing and observing aids activists were criticizing and protesting. Bearing grimm signs reading silence equals death. Two little funding they complain and too little urgency. Fear and grief and frustration hit hard. Finally president george hw bush who spoke about a kinder gentler america. Boosted funding. Fauci put research in high gear. Still it took three years of intense research before robert gallo of nih and luc montagnier of the pasteur institute. Announced that they had identified the virus that causes aids. A retrovirus that can intubate in the body for years. Before erupting into full-blown aids. Once the virus was isolated researchers went to work to defeat it. Molecular virologist started sequencing it. They examined the genetic code. Then researchers discovered the antibody test which allowed for pump diagnosis. They started experimenting with off-the-shelf compounds to see which might inhibit the virus. But it was by no means a straight line. Ever false hopes setbacks and flat-out standards. A promising drug azt emerge from this work. And the medical community's help us sudden uncharacteristic burst of hope. The disease might be rained in. But clinical trials and experience establish the azt lost effectiveness over time. Because the virus developed resistance to it. Researchers discovered the virus could replicate and mutate getting around azt. Asset-backed. Which led to a question. How do we stop the mutation and replication. Researchers tested more drugs and found that a cocktail of medication if taken together could backstop one another and prevent the virus from you tasting. The new regime approved in 1996 increase the patient's expected remaining life. 8 months to as much as 50 years. Hiv-aids still kills especially in poorer parts of the world. But decades of methodical research slow questions. Paid off. The disease is no longer an automatic death sentence. Science bases itself on the measurable world. But we can incorporate its method into the way we ask and answer other types of questions. To become more precise more focused more accurate. We can't slow down those are questions more deliberately and bring more data and facts to the discussion. We can challenge our hypothesis and invite others to do the same in a conscious search for problems with our findings and assumptions. Scientific questioning can be applied in business and daily life. And in our communities. Imagine how much more interesting the staff meeting corporate board retreat. Policy debate might be if people brought up an idea they had tried to prove wrong. Before they concluded it was right. You're thinking of putting money into your company because the competition is out hustling you. What do your customers want. Where is the demand. What are they buying. As you answer these questions you develop a strategy hypothesis you can test. You're not sleeping well. You wake up at 2 in the morning or can't get to sleep at all. Is it the caffeine the food or the stress. Before you go to the doctor to do one of those involved sleep studies. What can you figure out on your own. How can you experiment to narrow down the cause of your own insomnia. Perhaps creating a spreadsheet or gathering your data on your own digital fitness tracker which will tell you when you sleep and how you sleep will help. Chart your caffeine and exercise your diet and your stress level to look for patterns. Come up with a hypothesis intestine. From outer space to the subatomic particle. Scientific questioning probe the real world. Trying to figure out real mysteries. It relies on observation and measurement and it demands patience. It is a humbling form of questioning. Because it is endless. Dwarfed by the universe it seeks to decode. After studying this line of inquiry. I find myself questioning differently. I think more deeply about what i can see for myself the observable. I asked more about data separating what i know from what i think i know. I want to hear more about uncertainty and how we explain an accommodative. I have. What do we see and what do we actually know. How do we know what we know and how might we explain it. Could we be wrong. And what's the next question to ask. \""
